" We don't take that into account because it would make the regex too complex.
"
" Although,  you could  still replace  `.\{-}`  with `\_.\{-}`  to support  most

" Is `ALLBUT` really needed?  Can't I be more specific?{{{
"
" First, you need `containedin` for heredocs which are not at the toplevel.
"
" Second, you  could replace `ALLBUT` with  `vimFuncBody`, and it would  fix the
" highlighting of most heredocs which are not at the toplevel. But not all:
"
"     let dict.normal =<< trim END
"     i
"     xx
"     END
"
" Here, everything after `i` is highlighted as a string.
" The issue comes from the `normal` key; here, the highlighting is correct:
"
"              v
"     let dict.xormal =<< trim END
"     i
"     xx
"     END
"
" If you inspect the syntax highlighting on `=<< trim END`, you'll see `vimNormCmds`.
" So, you need `vimFuncBody` and `vimNormCmds`.
" But who knows what other corner cases exist which require additional syntax groups.
" If you want to cover all possible cases, you need `ALL`.
" But that would make you lose syntax highlighting in a commented heredoc.
" Final solution: use `ALLBUT,vimLineComment`.
